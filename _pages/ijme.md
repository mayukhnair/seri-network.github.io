The Indian Job Market for Economists (IJME) is a collaboration between the [Econometric Society](https://www.econometricsociety.org/), [National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER)](https://www.ncaer.org/) and SERI to facilitate matching of PhD economists and prospective employers. IJME will be scheduled in Delhi in December 2022. More information about how the market will work, including details on how to register, will be posted in mid-September. For email updates, please sign up for [SERI's mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/society-for-economics-research-in-india/).
